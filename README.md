# Dependencies

On Cygwin please install [these headers][linux_compat] to /usr/include.

The following libraries are required by android-tools:

1. [PCRE][PCRE]
2. [Google Test][gtest]
3. [protobuf][protobuf]
4. [brotli][brotli]
5. [zstd][zstd]
6. [lz4][lz4]
7. [zlib][zlib]

Python 3 is optionally needed as a run-time dependency in order to use
the `mkbootimg`, `unpack_bootimg`, and `repack_bootimg` scripts which
are all written in Python.

Additionally the following software is required at compile-time:

1. A C and C++ compiler (either [GCC][gcc] >= 10.X or [clang][clang])
2. The [Go compiler][golang]
3. [CMake][cmake]
4. [Perl][perl]

*Currently the build system doesn't check whether all of these are installed.*

# Installation

Source tarballs containing an already patched version of all vendored
dependencies are available on the [GitHub Release Page][release-page].

These tarballs should be used for packaging and general installation.
After the tarball was downloaded and extracted android-tools can be
build and installed as follows:

````shell
$ cmake -B build -G Ninja \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/ \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ cmake --build build
$ DESTDIR=install cmake --install build
````

# Generating tarballs

New source tarballs can be created from the Git repository using:

````shell
$ cmake -B build -G Ninja \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/ \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ ninja -C build package_source
````

Before a new release is uploaded a new `git-tag(1)` should be created
for the release. Afterwards the tarball can be uploaded to the [GitHub
Release Page][release-page].
